# Git Push CLI Tool

I always get tired of running the same Git commands again and again, so I sat down for 30 minutes and created this handy CLI tool to make my life easierâ€”and hopefully yours too! ðŸš€

## What Does It Do?
This tool simplifies your Git workflow:
- Set a default branch for pushing changes.
- Stage all your changes, commit them, and push to the default branch in one go.
- Letâ€™s you skip typing those repetitive Git commands.

No more typing `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push origin branch` over and over again. Just use this tool and chill. ðŸ˜Ž

### 1. Install the Tool
